# CSE 447 Natural Language Processing Project
This is the Repository for my CSE 447 Class Project. The project is a character-level prediction model that outputs the three next most likely
characters based on given text input. I used an RNN to completete this task. The model definition is located in https://github.com/VishnuKartha/CSE447Project/blob/main/FinalCheckpoint/src/utils.py.
